<h1>Understanding Security Controls</h1>
<p class="meta">Published by Cris • 2026</p>

<p>
Security controls are safeguards or countermeasures designed to protect
information systems from threats and risks. They play a critical role
in ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.
</p>

<p>
As part of my cybersecurity training, I conducted a control and compliance
audit for a fictional organization called Botium Toys. This exercise
helped me understand how security controls align with compliance
requirements and risk management.
</p>

<p>
Through this audit, I learned how organizations identify gaps in their
security posture and implement controls to reduce exposure to threats.
These lessons are essential for anyone starting out in cybersecurity.
